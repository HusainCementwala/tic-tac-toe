# **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
### **A JavaScript Project by [Husain Cementwala]**

## **About the Project**  
This project is a browser-based **Tic Tac Toe game** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game demonstrates core programming skills such as **DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation** while delivering an engaging user experience.  

This project is designed to:  
- Showcase clean and modular JavaScript code.  
- Demonstrate an understanding of game logic and win conditions.  
- Offer an interactive and responsive design for a seamless user experience.  

## **Features**  
1. **Dynamic Gameplay**:  
   - Two-player game with automatic turn switching.  
   - Real-time status updates (current playerâ€™s turn, win, or draw).  

2. **Game Logic**:  
   - Win condition checks for all possible scenarios (rows, columns, diagonals).  
   - Handles invalid moves and ensures smooth gameplay flow.  

3. **Reset Functionality**:  
   - Restart the game with a single click, resetting all cells and status text.  

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **HTML**: To structure the game board and interface.  
- **CSS**: For styling the grid, buttons, and overall game aesthetics.  
- **JavaScript**: To manage game logic, events, and dynamic updates.  

## **How to Play**  
1. Open the game in any modern browser.  
2. Take turns clicking on the grid to mark your symbol (X or O).  
3. The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins!  
4. If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.  
5. Click the **Restart** button to start a new game.  

## **Why This Project is Important**  
This project highlights my ability to:  
- **Apply programming fundamentals**: The logic-driven implementation demonstrates problem-solving and algorithm design skills.  
- **Create user-focused applications**: The intuitive interface and smooth interactions showcase a strong focus on user experience.  
- **Write clean, maintainable code**: Organized, modular, and reusable code ensures scalability and readability.  
- **Learn and innovate**: This project reflects my enthusiasm for coding and my ability to take on challenges while mastering core concepts.

## **Future Improvements**  
- Add an AI-powered single-player mode.  
- Implement a timer to enhance competitiveness.  
- Include customizable themes and sound effects.  

## **Conclusion**  
This Tic Tac Toe project is more than just a simple game; it's a testament to my ability to conceptualize, build, and refine applications that are both functional and engaging. It exemplifies my dedication to learning and my readiness to take on real-world software challenges.
